If you're looking to test Full-Text RSS, you can use the following article and feed URLs (right click links to copy URL):

## Articles

Full-Text RSS should return the article's content as a single-item feed.

1. [The Breaking Of The Corporate Media Monopoly](https://www.medialens.org/2017/the-breaking-of-the-corporate-media-monopoly/) by Medialens
1. [The sharks circling around Corbyn scent blood](https://www.jonathan-cook.net/blog/2018-03-26/the-sharks-circling-around-corbyn-scent-blood/) by Jonathan Cook
1. [Hold the Front Page. The Reporters are Missing](http://johnpilger.com/articles/hold-the-front-page-the-reporters-are-missing) by John Pilger

## Feeds

Full-Text RSS should transform the partial feed into a full-text feed.

1. [BBC News](http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml)
